Data Collection: In this step, you'll be using the Finnhub API to gather historical and/or real-time data for your chosen stocks.

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: This step involves cleaning the collected data and transforming it into a suitable format for analysis and modeling.

Feature Selection & Engineering: You'll have to decide which features (i.e., data points) are relevant to your trading strategy. This can involve some degree of trial and error, as well as statistical analysis.

Model Development & Training: Develop a model based on your chosen features and trading strategy. This could be anything from a simple moving average crossover strategy to a complex machine learning model.

Backtesting: This is where you test your model using historical data to see how it would have performed in the past.

Live Trading & Evaluation: After backtesting, you can start live trading using your model. Monitor its performance and adjust as necessary.
